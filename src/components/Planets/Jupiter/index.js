            12 Titans, 3 Cyclops and 3 Hecatoncheires (hundred handed). Uranus hated his children. His son, Chronus, a Titan, resented this and slashed him with a sickle.
            The blood from Uranus fell on Mother Earth Creating the Giants, the Fates and the Tree Nymphs. Chronus Fearing his son would usurp him ate his children. 
            Mother Earth saw this and adviced Rhea, Chronus's wife, to feed him a rock and hide Zeus. Chronus's Fears came true and Zeus became the ruler of living things.
