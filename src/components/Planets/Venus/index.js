            description=" Venus is the brightest star in the night sky. Due to the planets luminous appearance, its name comes from 
            Venus or Aphrodite, the Goddess of love and beauty. Although the planet appears to be beautiful from afar, it is a hostile place for life. 
            The longest probe that has lasted on Venus's surface so far has been 2 hours. Unlike Mercury, which contains the most craters of any planet,
            Venus crushes anything that goes inside its strong atmosphere. Also, there is a runaway green house effect. 
            Carbon Dioxide and Sulfur retain so much heat that lead melts when it enters Venus's atmosphere. 
            Despite this, there may be life in its atmosphere due to the presense of phosphine hypothesized to be the result 
            of biological process in the atmosphere.
